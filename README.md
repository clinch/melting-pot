# social-collab
A way for teams to collaborate on messages being sent to social media. This tool enables businesses and organizations to protect
social feeds, while empowering individual employees to contribute to messages that are posted.

## Concept
One central hub controls the release of messages onto various social networks. Social network (eg: Twitter) credentials are
kept secure and only the app itself needs to be granted permissions to post on behalf of the organization.

Employees or contributors are encouraged to submit message ideas to the hub for review before posting. Each submission must
be approved by a certain number of other contributors before being *released* onto social networks.

## Example
ACME Co. has a Twitter feed. They want to stay current and respond to events in real time. However, they do not want to hand out their
Twitter password to numerous employees for fear that someone will post something inappropriate or tarnish the image of their company.

Using **social-collab**, ACME Co. authorizes the app to send tweets, and creates a user account for each employee within social-collab.
Any employee can submit a tweet to social-collab, but the tweet is held until it is proofread and approved by at least one other ACME
employee. This reduces the chance that an inappropriate tweet is posted to ACME's Twitter timeline.

One day, Joe, an ACME employee has a great idea for a tweet while he's watching the Superbowl. He submits his tweet to social-collab
and instantly all the other ACME collaborators are notified of Joe's tweet. Mary like's Joe's tweet so she double checks Joe's spelling
and decides to approve the tweet. With the click of a single button, Mary provides the additional review step necessary and Joe's tweet
is released onto Twitter.
